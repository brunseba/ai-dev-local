# AI Dev Local

Welcome to AI Dev Local - a comprehensive AI lab for local development with various AI services and Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations.

## Overview

AI Dev Local provides a unified platform to run and manage multiple AI services locally, enabling developers to:

- **Observe and analyze** LLM interactions with Langfuse
- **Build visual workflows** with FlowiseAI
- **Chat with models** through Open WebUI
- **Proxy multiple LLM providers** with LiteLLM
- **Integrate development tools** via MCP servers
